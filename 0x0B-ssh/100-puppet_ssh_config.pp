#Letâ€™s practice using Puppet to make changes to our configuration file. Just as in the previous configuration file task, weâ€™d like you to set up your client SSH configuration file so that you can connect to a server without typing a password.

exec { 'auth without passwd':
  command => 'bash -c "echo PasswordAuthentication no >> /etc/ssh/ssh_config"',
  path    => '/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin'
}
exec { 'identity file':
  command => 'bash -c "echo IdentityFile \'~/.ssh/school\' >> /etc/ssh/ssh_config"',
  path    => '/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin'
}
